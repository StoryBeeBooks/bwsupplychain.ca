BW Supply

The global economy now evolves around technological innovation, rapid shifts in policy and ideology, and the precision execution of well-designed strategies. In this environment, supply chains are no longer just back-office functions—they are strategic levers that determine who can respond fastest, scale reliably, and capture sustainable margins.

With over 30 years of industrial development experience across Canada, the United States, China, Vietnam, Laos, India, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and many other markets, BW has built a deeply connected logistics and economic system that links production capacity, real demand, and trade flows across continents. This experience underpins everything we do in product sourcing, commodity market access, and China-origin logistics.

## A. Product Sourcing & Contract Manufacturing

### Overview

BW supports customers across the Americas with product sourcing and contract manufacturing in Asia, from single components to fully integrated box-build assemblies.

In markets defined by fast product cycles and evolving technologies, companies need supply solutions that can keep pace without sacrificing discipline. Our sourcing and manufacturing programs are designed to integrate directly with customers’ local manufacturing and final assembly operations, enabling flexibility, cost efficiency, and scalable production from pilot to mass volumes.

### Our Experience & Capabilities

Drawing on decades of cross-border industrial execution, BW has developed capabilities that allow customers to treat Asia-based sourcing as an extension of their own operations, rather than a black box.

Our experience and capabilities include:

- Designing sourcing programs that align Asian manufacturing capabilities with North and South American engineering, quality, and commercial requirements
- Structuring cost models and supplier agreements that remain durable through product changes, volume shifts, and input cost volatility
- Coordinating production planning and capacity so that supply closely tracks real demand and market conditions
- Integrating material flows from Asian suppliers into customers’ local manufacturing and final assembly schedules

In practice, this means BW can assume end-to-end responsibility for the supply side of the program, including:

- Supplier identification, qualification, and ongoing development
- Cost structure design, negotiation, and continuous optimization
- Quality management and in-process oversight with clear standards and feedback loops
- Cross-border logistics coordination tied to production and delivery requirements

These capabilities allow customers to focus on product roadmap, market development, and growth, while leveraging BW’s experience to manage the complexity and risk of cross-border sourcing and manufacturing.

## B. Commodity Sourcing & Market Access

### Overview

Commodity flows are increasingly shaped by policy changes, shifting trade frameworks, sustainability expectations, and risk management requirements. Producers and buyers alike need more than simple spot transactions—they need structured, transparent, and executable paths to market.

BW supports producers across the Americas by facilitating commodity supply opportunities that are aligned with **verified** demand in Asian markets, using a disciplined and commercially rigorous sourcing and market access process.

### Our Experience & Capabilities

From working across multiple commodity categories and jurisdictions over many years, BW has developed capabilities that help producers connect their output to real, executable demand in Asia.

Our experience and capabilities include:

- Representing producers’ products and production capabilities to qualified buyers with clearly defined volume, specification, and commercial requirements
- Matching supply with confirmed, rather than speculative, demand—reducing wasted effort and uncertainty for all parties
- Structuring commercial frameworks that balance risk, quality, logistics, and pricing expectations on both sides
- Navigating regulatory, logistical, and documentation requirements to move from intent to executed transaction

By working from confirmed demand and carefully vetted counterparties, BW is able to:

- Focus producer efforts on opportunities that have a clear and realistic path to transaction
- Improve visibility on volume commitments, quality expectations, and logistics planning
- Support producers in building repeatable positions in key Asian markets rather than one-off deals

These capabilities reflect not only what BW does, but how years of on-the-ground experience have shaped a more disciplined, demand-led approach to commodity sourcing and market access.

## C. China-Origin Logistics & Integrated Supply Services

### Overview

China remains a critical node in global trade—both for bulk commodities and finished products. At the same time, managing origin-side warehousing, consolidation, customs, inland transport, and international shipping in a coordinated way has become increasingly complex.

BW provides comprehensive China-origin logistics and integrated supply services that support both import and export flows. Our solutions are designed not just to move goods, but to give clients operational flexibility, cost control, and demand-driven delivery across cross-border supply chains.

### Our Experience & Capabilities

Built over decades of operating in China and across Asia, BW’s origin-side logistics capabilities are grounded in practical execution and continuous refinement.

Our experience and capabilities include:

- Designing end-to-end China-origin logistics programs that connect production sites, warehouses, ports, and international shipping into a single coordinated system
- Operating as a single interface for warehousing, consolidation, customs coordination, inland transportation, and international shipment execution
- Integrating origin infrastructure with real-time coordination and visibility so that goods can move based on actual demand rather than rigid shipping patterns

#### Core Capabilities

Supported by this experience, BW’s China-origin platform encompasses:

- **Large-scale origin warehousing network**
- Extensive coverage across major ports and logistics hubs in China
- Ambient, cold chain, and specialized storage options for different product requirements

### How Our Experience Adds Value

The way BW structures and operates origin-side logistics programs is a direct outcome of years of practical experience, and it is designed to reshape how inventory, cost, and risk are managed:

- **Demand-driven delivery models**
Origin warehousing and staged shipping enable clients to release inventory as sales materialize, rather than shipping everything in a single move. This supports better inventory turns, improved cash flow, and lower obsolescence risk.

- **Reduced destination-side warehousing pressure**
By using origin as the primary buffer, clients can:
- Reduce destination warehousing and handling costs
- Hold less capital in destination inventory
- Maintain responsiveness with shorter replenishment cycles

- **Improved supplier leverage**
Flexible origin storage and shipping options reduce the need for oversized, inflexible shipment commitments. This improves negotiation positions with suppliers and supports better alignment between order sizes, timing, and real demand.

- **End-to-end operational visibility**
With BW coordinating warehousing, inland transport, and international shipping, clients gain:
- Centralized visibility and reporting
- Clear exception handling and communication channels
- Data that can be used to refine planning, forecasting, and strategy
