                            <h3>Web Accessibility</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effective Date: February 2026</strong></p>
                            
                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">1. Commitment to Accessibility</h4>
                            <p>BW Supply Chain is committed, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable legal requirements and technical feasibility, to making our Website accessible to individuals with disabilities. However, we make no guarantees, warranties, or representations regarding the level of accessibility achieved, the specific standards met, or the completeness of any accessibility features or services.</p>
                            <p>Accessibility efforts are ongoing and may vary in scope, quality, and implementation. We reserve the right to modify, adjust, or discontinue accessibility features at any time without notice or liability. What may be considered accessible by us may not meet all applicable standards or individual accessibility needs.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">2. Website Accessibility Standards</h4>
                            <p>We may endeavor to align with certain web accessibility guidelines and technical standards, including but not limited to WCAG, Section 508, and other applicable accessibility frameworks. However, we do not warrant that our Website fully complies with any specific standard, guideline, or regulation. Compliance with accessibility standards is assessed at our discretion and may vary across different browsers, devices, operating systems, and user configurations.</p>
                            <p>Standards interpretation and implementation are subject to change, and our efforts toward conformance may not address all accessibility requirements or individual accessibility features. Some accessibility features may be incomplete, partially implemented, or unavailable.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">3. Technical Limitations</h4>
                            <p>Website accessibility is subject to various technical limitations, including but not limited to browser compatibility, plugin availability, device-specific constraints, user configuration settings, internet connectivity, and third-party software or services. We do not guarantee that accessibility features will function on all devices, browsers, or configurations. Technical incompatibilities, limitations, or failures may result in reduced accessibility without notice or liability.</p>
                            <p>Third-party content, embedded media, external applications, or linked resources may not be accessible, and we assume no responsibility for accessibility of such third-party elements. Users are responsible for configuring their own devices and software to optimize accessibility.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">4. Assistive Technologies and User Responsibility</h4>
                            <p>Accessibility may depend on user configuration of assistive technologies, tools, browser settings, or other adaptive measures. We do not guarantee that our Website will function properly with all assistive technologies, screen readers, or accessibility tools. Users are responsible for implementing and maintaining appropriate assistive technologies to access the Website.</p>
                            <p>We assume no liability for incompatibilities between the Website and any assistive technology, or for any outcomes or limitations arising from assistive technology use or configuration.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">5. Content and Functionality Accessibility</h4>
                            <p>While we attempt to present content, media, and functionality in accessible formats, we do not warrant that all Website elements are accessible. Certain content, including but not limited to images, videos, interactive elements, downloadable files, or embedded systems, may have limited or no accessibility features. Alternative formats or descriptions may or may not be available.</p>
                            <p>Dynamic content, real-time updates, complex interactions, or sophisticated functionality may present accessibility challenges that we do not undertake to resolve. Users may encounter barriers to certain Website features or functionality.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">6. Accessibility Improvements and Modifications</h4>
                            <p>We reserve the right to improve, modify, adjust, or discontinue any accessibility features at our discretion, with or without notice. Enhancements to Website accessibility are made at our sole discretion and may not address all accessibility needs or preferences. Accessibility features implemented today may be removed, changed, or unavailable in the future.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">7. Accessibility Contact and Reporting</h4>
                            <p>We appreciate feedback regarding Website accessibility. Users who encounter accessibility barriers or issues are encouraged to contact us, though we assume no obligation to respond to reports, investigate claims, or implement requested modifications within any specific timeframe or to your satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>Reports of accessibility issues do not constitute acknowledgment of liability or commitment to remediate. User suggestions and feedback are received on a voluntary basis and do not obligate us to modify our Website or accessibility practices.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">8. Disclaimer of Accessibility Warranties</h4>
                            <p>THE WEBSITE AND ALL ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES REGARDING ACCESSIBILITY, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE WEBSITE IS ACCESSIBLE, COMPLIANT WITH ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS, OR SUITABLE FOR USERS WITH DISABILITIES. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DIFFICULTIES, BARRIERS, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 32px;">9. Limitation of Liability</h4>
                            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ORGANIZATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES, BARRIERS, INCOMPATIBILITIES, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS THE WEBSITE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR ANY ACCESSIBILITY-RELATED CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED $100 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>

                            <p>We reserve the right to limit Website access or functionality for users who have disabled cookies or tracking technologies. Not all cookie preferences may be configurable, and opting out of certain tracking may not prevent all data collection.
